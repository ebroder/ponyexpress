I Can't Believe It's Not Gmail!

An IMAP server for people who like to control their own data.

ICBING provides the tagging/labelling features of Gimap. All folders
are virtual folders. Moving messages into that folder adds some tag to
the message; deleting a message in a folder removes that tag. The
contents of a folder are dynamically generated based on a query
associated with the folder.

By default, a folder corresponds to a tag of the same name, and shows
all messages with that tag.

For fast access and easy tag management, all e-mail is stored in a
database.

ICBING also provides a series of scripts for managing messages from
the command line or procmail.

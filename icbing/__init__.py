I Can't Believe It's Not Gmail!

An IMAP server for people who like to control their own data.

ICBING provides the tagging/labelling features of Gimap. Each folder
represents a tag. Moving messages into that folder adds the tag to the
message; deleting a message in a folder removes the tag. The contents
of a folder are all messages with that tag.

For fast access and easy tag management, all e-mail is stored in a
database.

ICBING also provides a series of scripts for managing messages from
the command line or procmail.
